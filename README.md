This document is a WIP and still needs more projects added and reformatting before it is final.

Info about me
My name is Jacob Gallagher and I am a 21 year old Software Engineer and Unity Game Developer with a Bachelor of Software Engineering (game programming) from Media Design School. 

Experience
I have 3 years experience developing many games and projects using c++, c# and Unity. I also have experience in Android, web dev (front end and back end), AI programming, multi-threading, networking, graphics (OpenGL and DirectX 12), physics, Unreal Engine and Gamemaker. I also have experience programming with Javascript, Lua and Swift.

I have a passion for music and audio and took up the role of Audio Director for the majority of group projects/games that I worked on. I also wrote a research paper on the impact of Adaptive Music on player feedback.

SkyWhale is a third person exploration collectathon created with Unity game Engine. Fly through the air on your Sky Whale, glider or closely behind your grappling hook! Solve puzzles and interact with NPCs to progress the story and unlock new movement mechanics. Collect floating coins to unlock development art and info in the gallery while you enjoy the delicately crafted audio-visual experience.

SkyWhale is GoonSquad's final year production game at Media Design School. 

It was an extremely informative process as we had to learn important communication and rescoping skills due to team members joining/leaving at different stages. During development a lack of artists required us programmers to focus on design work and pick up a few art related tasks on top of our programming, systems integration and bug-fixing work. 

I was the Audio director for this project and most of my other group projects and one of my priorities was creating and expanding the audio manager (singleton) which integrated with Unity's audio system and enabled me to easily trigger needed audio functionality from wherever needed in other scripts. This enabled me to cleanly play sound effects with one line from the relevant script and the sound effects to have automatically (partially) randomised pitch and volume to prevent them from soudning to repetitive. 

I also worked on: 
How sounds would adapt to to the game state, helped work on all the movement mechanics, a tile puzzle generator and tile puzzle system for the second island, the checkpoint system, designing the islands, setting up some of the quests, the jellyfish grapple points, movement behaviour of islands that trail behind the whale, debug tools, bugfixing and many other tasks.
